csct-poster-template
====================

Unofficial poster template for the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath. The included logos belong to their respective owners and should only be used with permission (i.e. following their guidance).

Currently a template is being developed for Scribus.
Scribus is open-source, cross-platform and well-suited to poster presentation as it supports CMYK colour and is designed to handle large documents. 
When this has reached a satisfactory stage of development, it may be ported to other formats;
 however some file formats are poorly-suited to source management and they may not appear here.
